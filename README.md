# ps5Spoofer<br>
Simple spoofer for PS5, patches the PS4 SDK to version 99.9 to prevent the console from asking for a system update, for the games to start they must be installed with the spoofer activated, supports versions 5,5.02,5.1 and 5.5, i am investigating how to make it work regardless of the firmware version

NOTE : Use this payload only in case of emergency, our friend Echo's latest kstuff already has the spoofer incorporated into its code, which is much more elegant than having the payload separately =)
